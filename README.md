# Machine_Learning_SP_500_Forecasting_Algorithm
Built a random forest machine learning model that uses rolling price averages to forecast price movements of the S&amp;P 500 stock index; trained using a training data set from S&P 500 price history

Backtested model against 30 years' worth of time series pricing data, with test/train sets, on the S&P 500 with a 4% alpha
